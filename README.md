Counter Strike 2 Base (C++)

This repository contains an incomplete base for a Counter-Strike 2 project written in C++ , I have been working on it for 4 months. It serves as a foundation for implementing features such as:

    Aimbot
    Anti-Aim
    Player List

Current Status

    Some signatures are outdated and need updating.
    Features are partially implemented or yet to be developed.

Contribution

Feel free to contribute by updating signatures, optimizing the code, or adding missing features. PRs are welcome!
